# Pytorch compiler playground
I am currently playing around with how DL compilers work

## Setup Guide
Prerequisites (for now)
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+

Create virtual environment
```python
python3 -m venv venv
# on unix
. venv/bin/activate
```

Currently all files are python, you can just run the tests. Soon i'll add support for C++ and use pybind as well
